            <h2>Iced Coffee, Dunkin Donuts, Incheon Airport, South Korea</h2>
            <img src="images/DDSK.jpg" width="500">
            <p>September 5, 2018 – It takes over 12 hours to fly from San Francisco to Incheon Airport. Despite having two coffees and intermittent sleep on the plane, landing on the other side of the international dateline at 2 a.m. is a recipe for needing more coffee. I was excited to use a Dunkin Donuts gift card I had been carrying since 2015. Unfortunately, it was only valid in the States. <br> Rating: 6/10 Consumed out of necessity, but overall underwhelming</p>

            <h2>McFloat, McDonalds, Cubayao, Philippines</h2>
            <img src="images/mcfloat.jpg" width="500">
            <p>September 8, 2018 – We woke up to watch the sun rise over Laguna Lake. On the way back to my uncle's house, my mother asked my cousin where we could get coffee. "McDo, po." The McFloat was not unlike a dressed up affogato. Clearly intended as a dessert, the staff appeared shocked when I ordered the McFloat before 7 a.m.<br>Rating: 3/10 I'm lactose intolerant and this was a bad decision.</p>

            <p>September 9, 2018 – On this whirlwind trip, I was seeing relatives almost every day. This was a small reunion and I ordered an espresso so I didn't seem too jetlagged. <br> Rating: 8/10 Did its job</p>

            <h2>Cafe Mocha, Hello Kitty Cafe, Metro Manila, Philippines</h2>
            <img src="images/HKmocha.jpg" width="500">
            <p>September 9, 2018 – This stop was as much for my sister as it was for me. She loves Hello Kitty; I love coffee. <br> Rating: 5/10 Presentation was dope, but the flavor wasn't there.</p>

            <h2>Caffe americano, Josephine, Tagaytay, Philippines</h2>
            <img src="images/Josephine.JPG" width="500">
            <p>September 10, 2018 – Stopped for brunch and to see the world's largest island within a lake on an island within a lake within an island. <br> Rating: 6/10 Really cool view of Taal, really basic coffee.</p>

            <h2>Thai Iced Coffee, Santa Rosa, Philippines</h2>
            <img src="images/thai-iced.jpg" width="500">
            <p>September 10, 2018 – Thai iced coffee is always good, but I am always lactose intolerant. <br> Rating: 9/10 worth the discomfort</p>

            <h2>Nestle&#769; Instant Coffee, Ate Desi's, Bin&#771;an, Philippines </h2>
            <img src="images/ateDesi.JPG" width="500" height="600">
            <p>September 12, 2018 – Ate Desi is my lolo's cousin. She says she's too young to be a tita or a lola – Filipino kinship terms to mean of your parents' or grandparents' generations, respectively. We sat outside and ate sweet bread while the tsismis discussed the garden.<br>Rating: 12/10 This coffee was really about experience, not the taste.</p>
