            <h2 class="h2">Iced Coffee, Dunkin Donuts, Incheon Airport, South Korea</h2>
            <p class = "description">September 5, 2018 – It takes over 12 hours to fly from San Francisco to Incheon Airport. Despite having two coffees and intermittent sleep on the plane, landing on the other side of the international dateline at 2 a.m. is a recipe for needing more coffee. I was excited to use a Dunkin Donuts gift card I had been carrying since 2015. Unfortunately, it was only valid in the States.</p>

            <h2>McFloat, McDonald's, Cubayao, Philippines</h2>
            <p class = "description">September 8, 2018 – We woke up to watch the sun rise over Laguna Lake. On the way back to my uncle's house, my mother asked my cousin where we could get coffee. "McDo, po." The McFloat was like a dressed up affogato. Clearly intended as a dessert, the staff appeared shocked when I ordered the McFloat before 7 a.m.</p>

She says she's too young to be a tita or a lola – Filipino kinship terms to mean of your parents' or grandparents' generations, respectively. We sat outside and ate sweet bread while the tsismis discussed the garden.</p>
